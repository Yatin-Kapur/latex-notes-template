# latex-notes-template
Simple note taking template for LaTeX.  
  
These instructions are only applicable for the MacVim texteditor, set up instructions for other text editors should be searched for on Google (I assume they are there somewhere).  
  
First of all, follow this guide if you don't have MacVim with pathogen installed on your Macbook: http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/112698/how-to-install-vim-latex  
  
Now, enter the vim-latex folder in your .vim file, and go to vim-latex/ftplugin/latex-suite  
If using command line, type "open templates" (without the apostrophes, of course). Paste the notes.tex file in this templates folder.
